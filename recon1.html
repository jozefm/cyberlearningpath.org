In the context of cybersecurity, reconnaissance is the practice of covertly discovering and collecting information about a device, system, application or person. This method is often used in Red Teaming, Ethical hacking and Penetration testing. 

Reconnaissance generally follows seven steps:

    Collect initial information
    Determine the network range
    Identify active machines
    Find access points and open ports 
    Fingerprint the operating system
    Discover services on ports
    Map the network

Using these steps, an attacker will aim to gain the following information about a network:

    File permissions
    Running network services
    OS platform
    Trust relationships
    User account information 

One of the most common techniques involved with reconnaissance is port scanning, which sends data to various TCP and UDP (user datagram protocol) ports on a device and evaluates the response. 
Differences Between Passive and Active Reconnaissance

There are two main types of reconnaissance: active and passive reconnaissance. 

With active reconnaissance, hackers interact directly with the computer system and attempt to obtain information through techniques like automated scanning or manual testing and tools like ping and netcat. Active recon is generally faster and more accurate, but riskier because it creates more noise within a system and has a higher chance of being detected.

Passive reconnaissance gathers information without directly interacting with systems, using tools such as Wireshark and Shodan and methods such as OS fingerprinting to gain information. 
How To Prevent Reconnaissance

Organizations can use penetration testing to determine what their network would reveal in the event of a reconnaissance attack. Organizations can outsource the work by hiring security testing professionals to carry out penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, compliance testing, etc.

During testing, organizations can deploy port scanning tools (which scan large networks and determine which hosts are up) and vulnerability scanners (which find known vulnerabilities in the network).
